## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Pharmaceutical Company ‘Apollo Healthcare’ manufactures the active ingredient for its blockbuster drug ‘Asclepius’ in a processing plant. The Manufacturing Science Group have been asked to optimise the production process to increase the yield of the active ingredient. The theoretical yield is between 28 and 32Kg per batch based on standard inputs and management would like to see yields increased to approach the max theoretical yield of 32Kgs. The Manufacturing Science Group have identified 4 Process Variables which they would like to investigate to see if there is any correlation between them and the yield.

### PROJECT PLAN
#### 1.	CREATE THE VARIABLES
#### 2. CREATE A DATAFRAME
#### 3. GENERATE SUMMARY STATISTICS
#### 4. PLOT THE DATA
#### 5.
